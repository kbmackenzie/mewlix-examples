A simple dice roller. Dice can be rolled with a subset of [dice notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation).

Specifically, dice rolls should be in the form of `xdy`, where `x` is the amount of dice to be rolled and `y` is the kind of die. `2d20`, for example, means rolling two 20-sided dice.
